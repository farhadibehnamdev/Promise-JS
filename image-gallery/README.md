### Project: **Image Gallery with Fetch**

#### Goal:

Create an image gallery that fetches images from a public API (e.g., Unsplash API), displays them in a structured format, and handles loading, errors, and user interactions efficiently.

---

### **Task 1: Setup Project Structure**

- **Description:** Set up the basic structure for the project.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Create the project folder.
  - Inside, create essential files:
    - `index.html` (for the gallery structure)
    - `style.css` (for the layout and styles)
    - `script.js` (where you’ll write the JavaScript logic)
- **Focus:** Understand how the different parts (HTML, CSS, JS) will work together.

---

### **Task 2: Basic HTML & Layout Design**

- **Description:** Define the basic structure of the image gallery in HTML.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Design a basic grid or layout where images will be displayed.
  - Add placeholder content so you can see how the layout will look.
- **Focus:** HTML structure and CSS styling; don’t focus on dynamic content just yet.

---

### **Task 3: Fetch Data from a Public API**

- **Description:** Fetch data (images) from the Unsplash API (or another public image API).
- **Deliverables:**
  - Learn how to sign up and get an API key if needed.
  - Use the `fetch()` function to request data from the API.
  - Handle the response using Promises or async/await.
  - Ensure error handling (e.g., network issues, failed API response).
- **Focus:** Fetching data asynchronously, understanding response structures, and error handling.

---

### **Task 4: Display Fetched Images in the Gallery**

- **Description:** Dynamically insert the images fetched from the API into the gallery.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Parse the API response to get the image URLs.
  - Use JavaScript to dynamically create HTML elements (like `<img>`) and insert them into the gallery layout.
  - Ensure the layout works with real images.
- **Focus:** DOM manipulation and displaying asynchronous data.

---

### **Task 5: Loading State and Error Handling**

- **Description:** Implement a loading state while the images are being fetched and handle errors gracefully.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Add a “loading” indicator while the API call is in progress (e.g., a spinner or message).
  - Display a user-friendly error message if the API request fails (network issues, API limit exceeded, etc.).
- **Focus:** UX enhancements for loading states and error handling for failed requests.

---

### **Task 6: Optimize API Requests**

- **Description:** Add pagination or lazy loading to optimize API calls and improve performance.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Implement pagination (load more images when the user scrolls down or clicks a “Load More” button).
  - Optionally, you could implement infinite scrolling.
- **Focus:** Handling multiple API calls asynchronously, improving performance, and managing larger datasets.

---

### **Task 7: Final Styling & Polish**

- **Description:** Refine the design and add any final touches to the gallery.
- **Deliverables:**
  - Improve the styling (responsive layout, hover effects, transitions).
  - Ensure that the gallery looks good on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Focus:** Improving the visual appeal and responsiveness of the gallery.
